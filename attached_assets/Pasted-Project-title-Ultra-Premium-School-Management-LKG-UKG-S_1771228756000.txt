Project title: Ultra-Premium School Management — LKG/UKG SaaS Demo (Visual & Interactive Prototype)

Goal:
Generate an ULTRA-PREMIUM clickable prototype (visual + interactive) for a scalable school-management SaaS targeted at LKG/UKG schools. This is a demo that must *feel* production-grade (startup-level polish) so the client believes a $50K implementation is justified. Use mock JSON data only — no external API keys or real payments/SMS.

Primary impression: polished, trustworthy, and mobile-first. Think “premium edtech startup UI” — soft pastels, glassmorphism, micro-interactions, smooth transitions, and a clear design system.

Tech stack (preferred):
- Frontend: React (Vite) — if generator prefers Next.js for SSR, allowed but keep same component API.
- Styling & design: TailwindCSS + design tokens (CSS vars) + Framer Motion for transitions
- Icons: lucide-react or heroicons
- Charts: Recharts or chart.js (static/mock data)
- Backend: Node.js + Express mock API (in-memory, no DB) exposing REST endpoints
- PWA support: manifest + service worker caching
- Build & run: `npm install` && `npm run dev` (both client & server via single concurrent command)
- Provide a Dockerfile (optional) and a Vercel-friendly deployment config

Design system & visuals:
- Provide a small design system: color tokens, typography scale, spacing scale, border radius tokens.
- Glassmorphism panels + soft pastel palette suitable for kindergarten (accent + 2 neutrals).
- Subtle elevation shadows, 8–10px border radii, large tap targets (48px).
- Micro-interactions: button hover scale, card entrance animations, toasts, skeleton loaders, and a 3-step onboarding tour (coach marks).
- Include one Lottie animation for the landing hero (kids / school theme).

User roles & flows:
- Super Admin (demo-only)
- Admin (office)
- Teacher
- Parent (mobile-first)

Login:
- Role selector login screen (no real auth). Option to "simulate" a parent/teacher/admin account.
- Show a small modal to pick a demo class (LKG A, UKG B).

   - Simple date-range selector and sample report preview modal

10. Accessibility, Localization & Polish

   - Responsible layout for 320–1440px
   - Provide readable Malayalam-friendly font fallback (e.g., Noto Sans Malayalam)

Mock Data (exact file):
- `mock/data.json` containing:
  - 12 students (Kerala-style names: Anu Nair, Aarav Varghese, Meera S, Alphy Thomas, Riya K, Devika P, Arjun S, Maya V, Vivek K, Sneha M, Rahul T, Neha P) — classes: LKG A, LKG B, UKG A
  - 3 teachers
  - 6 fee records (mix of paid/pending)
  - 6 notices
  - 4 sample admissions/enquiries

UI Requirements & Microcopy:
- Provide consistent microcopy for toasts and modals (e.g., “Attendance saved — mock”, “Mock payment successful”)
- Provide 3 screenshot PNGs in `/assets`: admin-dashboard.png, teacher-attendance.png, parent-home.png
- Provide an “elevator demo script” (3–4 lines) for each role to read live during client demo.

Dev & Repo Deliverables:
- Full repo scaffold with `frontend/` and `backend/` folders and a root README.
- Clean folder structure, modular components, and sample env files.
- README: run steps, deploy hints for Vercel, and a 1-minute demo script for the presenter.
- Provide a `design-tokens.json` and a small `style-guide.md` describing colors, fonts, and motion timings.
- Provide a `package.json` scripts: `dev`, `start`, `build`, `preview`.
- If possible, produce a single zip or repo output; otherwise include full file tree and full source files in the response.

Quality bar (don’t hand me sloppy):
- No placeholder Lorem Ipsum in primary screens.
- Animations must be subtle, not cheesy.
- Components must be reusable and named clearly.
- Provide small unit of docs on how to convert mock API into real backend (endpoints list & data contract).

Constraints:
- NO real payments, SMS, or OTP integration.
- Use in-memory/mock persistence only.
- State can reset on refresh — but UI should reflect session changes during the demo.

Final note for generator:
This must *feel* enterprise-grade for a paying client — crisp visuals, intentional UX, and an impression the app is ready to become a production MERN system. Prioritize design, motion, and clarity over adding dozens of half-baked features.
